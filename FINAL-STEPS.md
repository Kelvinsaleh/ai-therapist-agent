## What You Need to Do (2 Minutes) ⚠️

I **cannot** access your Gmail account, so you need to:

### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password (2 minutes)

Open these two links:

**Link 1:** Enable 2FA (if not already)
```
https://myaccount.google.com/security
```
- Click "2-Step Verification"
- Follow prompts to enable it

**Link 2:** Generate App Password
```
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
```
- Select: **Mail**
- Select: **Other** (type "Hope Backend")
- Click **Generate**
- **Copy the 16-character password** (like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Update .env File (30 seconds)

Open the file I created: **`Hope-backend/.env`**

Find lines 23-24 and update:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=paste16charpasswordhere
```

Example:
```env
EMAIL_USER=john@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Remove the spaces** from the password when pasting!

### Step 3: Restart Servers (1 minute)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd Hope-backend
npm run dev
```

Look for:
```
✅ Email service initialized successfully
📧 Using: your-email@gmail.com via smtp.gmail.com:587
🚀 Server is running on port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## That's It! 🎉

Once you update those 2 lines and restart, everything will work:

✅ Meditation uploads up to 200MB  
✅ OTP emails sent automatically  
✅ User registration working  
✅ Welcome emails sent

## Quick Verification

Run this to check everything:
```powershell
.\VERIFY-FIXES.ps1
```

## Summary

**What I did:** Everything except get your Gmail password (impossible for me)
