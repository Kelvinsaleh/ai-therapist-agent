## 🚨 Still Needs Fixing (CRITICAL)

### 1. Mock Authentication in Session Route
**File:** `app/api/auth/session/route.ts` (Lines 13-23 - STILL PRESENT)

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED (signin removed, session still has mock)

**What to do:**
The mock token check is still in the session validation. While it has a fallback to real validation, it's a security risk. Consider removing it entirely or guarding with environment check:

```typescript
// Option 1: Remove completely (Recommended)
// Delete the mock token check

// Option 2: Guard with environment (If needed for development)
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && token === "mock-jwt-token-for-testing") {
  // ... mock response
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables Not Set
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT SET

**Critical Variables Needed:**

**Vercel (Frontend):**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

**Render (Backend):**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (For AI insights)
- `JWT_SECRET` (For auth tokens)
- `MONGODB_URI` (Already set)
- `FRONTEND_URL` (For CORS)

**Action:** Set these in deployment dashboards NOW

### 3. Console.log Statements (107 instances)
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT FIXED

**Impact:**
- Performance degradation
- Security risk (exposes data)
- Unprofessional in production

**Quick fix options:**

**Option A:** Comment out all console.log
```bash
# PowerShell script to comment out console.log
Get-ChildItem -Path app -Filter "*.tsx","*.ts" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    (Get-Content $_.FullName) -replace 'console\.log\(', '// console.log(' | 
    Set-Content $_.FullName
}
```

**Option B:** Add environment guards (Better)
```typescript
// Create lib/utils/logger.ts
export const logger = {
  log: (...args: any[]) => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      console.log(...args);
    }
  },
  error: (...args: any[]) => console.error(...args), // Always log errors
  warn: (...args: any[]) => console.warn(...args),
};

// Replace console.log with logger.log
```
