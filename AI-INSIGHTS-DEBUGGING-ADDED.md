# AI Insights Debugging - ADDED 🔍

## 🎯 **Issue Identified:**
AI insights are failing with 400 error and falling back to hardcoded insights instead of using real Gemini AI.

## 🔧 **Debugging Added:**

### **1. Frontend Debugging** ✅
- **Added console logs** to track what data is being sent to the insights API
- **Enhanced request data** to include all relevant fields (mood, emotions, situation)
- **Added response logging** to see what the backend returns

### **2. API Route Debugging** ✅
- **Added console logs** to track incoming requests
- **Added backend response logging** to see what the backend returns
- **Added dynamic rendering** to prevent build issues

### **3. Enhanced Request Data** ✅
- **Before**: Only sent `text` and `type`
- **After**: Sends complete data including:
  - `text`: The automatic thoughts
  - `type`: 'thought_analysis'
  - `mood`: Current mood level
  - `emotions`: Array of emotions
  - `situation`: The situation description

## 🔍 **Debug Information Added:**

### **Frontend Logs:**
```typescript
console.log('Sending CBT insights request:', requestData);
console.log('CBT insights response status:', response.status);
console.log('CBT insights response data:', data);
```

### **API Route Logs:**
```typescript
console.log('CBT insights API received:', body);
console.log('Backend response status:', response.status);
console.log('Backend response data:', data);
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the CBT thought record saving** with the new debugging
2. **Check console logs** to see:
   - What data is being sent to the API
   - What the backend receives
   - What the backend responds with
   - Why it's returning 400 error

3. **Identify the root cause** of the 400 error:
   - Missing required fields
   - Wrong data format
   - Backend validation issues
   - Authentication problems

## 📋 **Expected Console Output:**

When you save a CBT thought record, you should see:
```
Sending CBT insights request: {
  text: "I'm not good enough",
  type: "thought_analysis", 
  mood: 3,
  emotions: ["anxiety", "sadness"],
  situation: "Work presentation"
}

CBT insights API received: { ... }
Backend response status: 400
Backend response data: { error: "..." }
```

## 🎯 **Troubleshooting:**

The debugging will help identify:
- ✅ **Data Format Issues**: If the request data is malformed
- ✅ **Backend Validation**: If required fields are missing
- ✅ **Authentication Issues**: If the token is invalid
- ✅ **Backend Errors**: If the backend is rejecting the request

**Try saving a CBT thought record now and check the console logs to see what's causing the 400 error! 🔍**
