# üî¥ Fix Render SMTP Connection Timeout

## Problem

Your logs show:
```
Error: Connection timeout
ETIMEDOUT to smtp.gmail.com:587
```

**Root Cause:** Render blocks outgoing SMTP connections on port 587 (standard port) to prevent spam.

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Use Gmail Port 465 (SSL) - Quick Fix

Update your Render environment variables:

**Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Environment

**Change:**
```
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

**To:**
```
EMAIL_PORT=465
```

**Save and redeploy.** This uses SSL which Render allows.

### Solution 2: Use SendGrid (Recommended for Production) ‚≠ê

SendGrid is free (100 emails/day) and works reliably on Render.

#### Step 1: Sign Up for SendGrid
1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com
2. Create free account
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Generate API Key
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it "Hope Therapy Backend"

#### Step 3: Update Render Environment Variables

**Replace** your EMAIL_* variables with:
```
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-sendgrid-api-key>
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

**Important:** 
- EMAIL_USER is literally the word `apikey` (not your email!)
- EMAIL_PASSWORD is your SendGrid API key

#### Step 4: Verify Sender Email (SendGrid Requirement)
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Click "Verify a Single Sender"

## üöÄ My Recommendation

**Use Solution 2 (SendGrid)** because:

## Alternative: Mailgun, AWS SES, Postmark

If SendGrid doesn't work, these are also good:
- **Mailgun:** Free 5,000 emails/month (first 3 months)

- **Postmark:** Free 100 emails/month

All use SMTP and work with Render.
