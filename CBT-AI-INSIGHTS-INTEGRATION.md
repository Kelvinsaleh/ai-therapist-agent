# CBT AI-Powered Insights Integration

## Overview
Upgraded the CBT system to use **Google's Gemini AI** for intelligent, personalized insights instead of hardcoded responses. The system now provides real-time AI analysis of thoughts, moods, and behaviors.

## What Changed

### 🤖 Backend AI Integration (Hope-backend/src/controllers/cbtController.ts)

#### New Function: `generateAICBTInsights()`
Generates AI-powered insights using Google Gemini AI based on user input.

**Supported Analysis Types:**

1. **Thought Analysis** (`thought_analysis`)
   - AI identifies cognitive distortions
   - Generates challenging questions
   - Suggests balanced alternative thoughts
   - Assesses severity level

2. **Mood Analysis** (`mood_analysis`)
   - Personalized coping strategies
   - Urgency assessment
   - Activity suggestions
   - Supportive messages

3. **General Insights** (`general_insights`)
   - Identifies distortions in text
   - Recommends coping strategies
   - Overall mental health assessment
   - Actionable recommendations

#### Enhanced Function: `getCBTInsights()`
- Now uses AI to generate personalized recommendations based on user's CBT history
- Falls back to rule-based recommendations if AI fails
- Analyzes patterns in cognitive distortions
- Identifies most effective techniques for the user

### 📍 New API Endpoint

```
POST /cbt/insights/generate
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "I always fail at everything I try",
  "type": "thought_analysis"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cognitiveDistortions": [
      "All-or-nothing thinking",
      "Overgeneralization"
    ],
    "challengingQuestions": [
      "What evidence do you have that you 'always' fail?",
      "Can you think of times when you succeeded?",
      "What would you tell a friend who said this?"
    ],
    "balancedSuggestions": [
      "I've had some failures, but I've also had successes",
      "Failure is part of learning and growth"
    ],
    "severity": "moderate"
  }
}
```

### 🎨 Frontend Integration (app/api/cbt/insights/route.ts)

Updated the insights API route to:
- Forward requests to backend AI endpoint
- Support both POST (generate new) and GET (fetch historical)
- Remove all hardcoded logic
- Rely entirely on AI for analysis

## How It Works

### 1. User Input Analysis Flow

```
User enters thought
    ↓
Frontend calls /api/cbt/insights
    ↓
Next.js API forwards to /cbt/insights/generate
    ↓
Backend uses Gemini AI to analyze
    ↓
AI returns structured JSON insights
    ↓
Frontend displays personalized results
```

### 2. AI Prompts

The system uses carefully crafted prompts for each analysis type:

**Thought Analysis Prompt:**
```
You are a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) expert. Analyze the following thought and provide insights:

Thought: "I always fail at everything I try"

Please provide a JSON response with:
1. cognitiveDistortions: Array of identified cognitive distortions
2. challengingQuestions: Array of 3-5 questions to challenge this thought
3. balancedSuggestions: Array of 2-3 alternative balanced thoughts
4. severity: "low", "moderate", or "high"
```

**Mood Analysis Prompt:**
```
You are a CBT therapist. Analyze this mood and situation:

Mood Level: 3/10
Emotions: Sad, Anxious
Situation: "Having a difficult day at work"

Please provide a JSON response with:
1. copingStrategies: Array of 4-6 personalized coping strategies
2. urgency: "immediate", "moderate", or "routine"
3. suggestedActivities: Array of 3-5 activities that could help
4. supportiveMessage: A brief, empathetic message
```

### 3. Historical Insights with AI

When users request their historical insights:
- System analyzes past 30 days of CBT data
- Identifies patterns in cognitive distortions
- Determines most effective techniques
- **AI generates personalized recommendations** based on user's unique patterns
- Provides fallback recommendations if AI is unavailable

## API Usage Examples

### Generate Thought Analysis
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/cbt/insights', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "Nobody likes me",
    type: "thought_analysis"
  })
});
```

### Generate Mood Analysis
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/cbt/insights', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "Feeling overwhelmed today",
    type: "mood_analysis",
    mood: 3,
    emotions: ["Anxious", "Sad"],
    situation: "Deadline pressure at work"
  })
});
```

### Get Historical Insights
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/cbt/insights', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
```

## Benefits of AI Integration

✅ **Personalized**: Every insight is tailored to the specific user input
✅ **Intelligent**: AI understands context and nuance
✅ **Dynamic**: No hardcoded responses - always fresh and relevant
✅ **Evidence-Based**: Uses CBT principles in analysis
✅ **Scalable**: Handles unlimited types of thoughts and situations
✅ **Learning**: AI adapts to complex emotional states
✅ **Professional**: Responses aligned with therapeutic best practices

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

**Backend (.env):**
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key-here
```

Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- Graceful fallback if AI service is unavailable
- JSON parsing with error recovery
- Fallback to rule-based insights for historical data
- Clear error messages to frontend

## Testing the AI Insights

### 1. Test Thought Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST https://hope-backend-2.onrender.com/cbt/insights/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "I am a complete failure",
    "type": "thought_analysis"
  }'
```

### 2. Test Mood Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST https://hope-backend-2.onrender.com/cbt/insights/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Feeling very stressed",
    "type": "mood_analysis",
    "mood": 2,
    "emotions": ["Stressed", "Overwhelmed"]
  }'
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: AI insights typically return in 2-5 seconds
- **Caching**: Consider caching similar requests for performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Gemini AI rate limits
- **Fallbacks**: Always have fallback responses ready

## Future Enhancements

1. **Context Awareness**: Include user's full CBT history in prompts
2. **Multi-turn Dialogue**: Allow follow-up questions
3. **Progress Tracking**: Show how insights evolve over time
4. **Custom Models**: Fine-tune models for mental health
5. **Multi-language**: Support insights in multiple languages

## Security & Privacy

- All AI requests require authentication
- User data is never stored by Gemini
- Prompts are sanitized before sending
- Responses are validated before storage
- HIPAA compliance considerations for production

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Hardcoded)
```javascript
if (distortions.length > 2) {
  return "high_distortion";
}
```

### After (AI-Powered)
```javascript
AI analyzes: "I always fail" 
↓
Returns: {
  cognitiveDistortions: ["All-or-nothing thinking", "Overgeneralization"],
  challengingQuestions: [
    "What evidence supports this belief?",
    "Are there times when you've succeeded?"
  ],
  balancedSuggestions: [
    "I've had both successes and failures, which is normal"
  ],
  severity: "moderate"
}
```
