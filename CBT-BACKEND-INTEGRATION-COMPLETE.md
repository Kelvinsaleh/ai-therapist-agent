# CBT Backend Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated a complete Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) backend system with the Hope AI Therapist Agent. The CBT feature is now fully functional and connected to the backend.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Models (Hope-backend/src/models/)
Created two MongoDB models for CBT data persistence:

#### CBTThoughtRecord Model
- Stores user thought records with cognitive behavioral therapy elements
- Fields: situation, automaticThoughts, emotions, emotionIntensity, evidenceFor, evidenceAgainst, balancedThought, cognitiveDistortions
- Indexed for fast querying by userId and date

#### CBTActivity Model  
- Tracks all CBT-related activities and their effectiveness
- Supports multiple activity types: thought_record, mood_entry, ai_cbt_session, cbt_insight, relaxation, activity_scheduling
- Records mood changes before/after activities
- Effectiveness tracking (0-10 scale)

### 2. Backend Controller (Hope-backend/src/controllers/cbtController.ts)
Implemented comprehensive CBT functionality:

**Thought Records**
- `saveThoughtRecord()` - Create new thought records
- `getThoughtRecords()` - Retrieve user's thought records with pagination

**CBT Activities**
- `saveCBTActivity()` - Log CBT activities with effectiveness tracking
- `getCBTActivities()` - Get activities filtered by type

**Progress & Analytics**
- `getCBTProgress()` - Calculate user progress metrics:
  - Thought records completed
  - Activities scheduled
  - Mood entries count
  - Relaxation sessions
  - Goals achieved
  - Weekly streak calculation
  
- `getCBTInsights()` - Generate personalized insights:
  - Common cognitive distortions identified
  - Most effective techniques
  - Mood-CBT correlation analysis
  - Personalized recommendations

- `getCBTAnalytics()` - Detailed analytics over time periods (7/30/90 days):
  - Timeline of thought records
  - Mood progression
  - Activity effectiveness trends

**Mood Integration**
- `saveMoodEntryWithCBT()` - Save mood entries with CBT insights
- `getMoodEntriesWithCBT()` - Retrieve mood history with CBT data

### 3. Backend Routes (Hope-backend/src/routes/cbt.ts)
Created RESTful API endpoints:

```
POST   /cbt/thought-records     - Create thought record
GET    /cbt/thought-records     - Get thought records
POST   /cbt/activities          - Create CBT activity
GET    /cbt/activities          - Get CBT activities
GET    /cbt/progress            - Get user progress
GET    /cbt/insights            - Get CBT insights
GET    /cbt/analytics           - Get detailed analytics
POST   /cbt/mood-entries        - Create mood entry with CBT
GET    /cbt/mood-entries        - Get mood entries with CBT
```

All routes protected with `authenticateToken` middleware.

### 4. Backend Integration (Hope-backend/src/index.ts)
- Registered CBT routes in main server file
- Added `/cbt` endpoint prefix
- Integrated with existing authentication and error handling

### 5. Frontend API Routes (app/api/cbt/)
Updated all frontend API routes to connect to real backend:

**Updated Files:**
- `progress/route.ts` - Fetches real progress from backend
- `thought-records/route.ts` - POST/GET thought records from backend
- `activities/route.ts` - POST/GET activities from backend
- `mood-entries/route.ts` - POST/GET mood entries from backend
- `analytics/route.ts` - Fetches analytics from backend
- `insights/route.ts` - Generates CBT insights (client-side + backend)

All routes now:
- Use proper backend URL (production: https://hope-backend-2.onrender.com)
- Pass authorization headers correctly
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return consistent response formats

### 6. CBT Service Layer (lib/api/cbt-service.ts)
Already existed - provides TypeScript service for CBT operations:
- TypeScript interfaces for all CBT data types
- Methods for all CBT operations
- Automatic backend communication via `backendService`

## API Endpoint Usage

### Creating a Thought Record
```javascript
POST /cbt/thought-records
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "situation": "Had a disagreement with my boss",
  "automaticThoughts": "I always mess up everything",
  "emotions": ["Anxious", "Frustrated"],
  "emotionIntensity": 8,
  "evidenceFor": "I made a mistake last week",
  "evidenceAgainst": "I've been praised many times",
  "balancedThought": "I made one mistake, but I'm generally competent",
  "cognitiveDistortions": ["All-or-nothing thinking", "Overgeneralization"]
}
```

### Getting Progress
```javascript
GET /cbt/progress
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "progress": {
    "thoughtRecordsCompleted": 12,
    "activitiesScheduled": 5,
    "moodEntries": 20,
    "relaxationSessions": 8,
    "goalsAchieved": 3,
    "weeklyStreak": 4,
    "lastActivity": "2025-10-19T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Getting Insights
```javascript
GET /cbt/insights
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "insights": {
    "commonDistortions": [
      {
        "distortion": "Catastrophizing",
        "frequency": 8,
        "trend": "decreasing"
      }
    ],
    "effectiveTechniques": [
      {
        "technique": "thought_record",
        "effectiveness": 8.5,
        "usage": 12
      }
    ],
    "moodCBTCorrelation": 0.75,
    "recommendations": [
      "Focus on challenging catastrophizing thoughts",
      "Continue using thought records - they're effective for you"
    ]
  }
}
```

  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  situation: String,
  automaticThoughts: String,
  emotions: [String],
  emotionIntensity: Number (0-10),

## Frontend Integration

### CBT Dashboard (app/cbt/dashboard/page.tsx)
- Already exists and displays CBT progress
- Now connects to real backend data
- Shows thought records, mood entries, activities
- Displays weekly streaks and achievements

### Using the CBT Service
```typescript
import { cbtService } from '@/lib/api/cbt-service';

// Save a thought record
const thoughtRecord = await cbtService.saveThoughtRecord({
  situation: "...",
  automaticThoughts: "...",
  // ... other fields
});

// Get progress
const progress = await cbtService.getCBTProgress();

// Get insights
const insights = await cbtService.getCBTInsights();
```
