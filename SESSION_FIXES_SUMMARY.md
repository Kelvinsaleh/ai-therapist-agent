## ⚠️ Issue #2: OTP Verification Emails Not Sending

### Problem
Users registering for accounts are not receiving email verification codes (OTP).

### Root Cause
The backend email service is **not configured**. Missing environment variables:
- `EMAIL_USER` - Email address to send from
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - App password for email account
- `EMAIL_HOST` - SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com)
- `EMAIL_PORT` - SMTP port (587)

### Current Behavior
- Backend logs show: `❌ EMAIL SERVICE NOT CONFIGURED`
- Users cannot verify their accounts
- In development mode, OTP appears in backend console logs
- In production, emails simply don't send

### Solution

#### Quick Fix (5 Minutes - Gmail)

**Step 1: Enable 2FA on Gmail**
- Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
- Enable "2-Step Verification"

**Step 2: Generate App Password**
- Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Select: Mail → Other (name it "Hope Backend")
- Copy the 16-character password

**Step 3: Create .env File**
```bash
cd Hope-backend
# Create .env file with this content:
```

```env
# Server
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://knsalee:SyB11T1OcCTa0BGz@hope-ai.yzbppbz.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=HOPE-AI

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# GEMINI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here

# FRONTEND
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# EMAIL SERVICE (Required!)
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# BLOB (if needed)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-vercel-blob-token
```

**Step 4: Restart Backend**
```bash
cd Hope-backend
npm run dev
```

**Step 5: Verify**
Backend logs should show:
```
✅ Email service initialized successfully
📧 Using: your-email@gmail.com via smtp.gmail.com:587
```

#### Alternative: Use Setup Script
```powershell
# Run from project root
.\setup-email.ps1
```

This interactive script will:
- Guide you through email setup
- Create the .env file automatically
- Configure Gmail, Outlook, or SendGrid

### Files Created/Updated
- `Hope-backend/.env` (you must create this)
- `setup-email.ps1` (automated setup script)
- `OTP_EMAIL_FIX.md` (detailed fix guide)

### Action Required ⚠️
1. **Create Hope-backend/.env file** with email credentials
2. **Restart backend server**
3. **Test registration** with real email
4. **Check email inbox** for verification code

### Production Deployment
For production (Render/Railway/Vercel), add environment variables:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

Or use production email service (recommended):
- **SendGrid** (Free: 100 emails/day)
- **AWS SES** (Pay-as-you-go)
- **Mailgun**, **Postmark**, etc.

### Documentation
- See `OTP_EMAIL_FIX.md` for complete guide
- See `Hope-backend/EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- Run `setup-email.ps1` for automated setup

## Troubleshooting

### Meditation Uploads Still Failing

3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check backend logs for detailed errors
5. Try smaller file first (50MB)

### OTP Emails Still Not Sending
1. Ensure `.env` file is in `Hope-backend/` directory
2. Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correct
