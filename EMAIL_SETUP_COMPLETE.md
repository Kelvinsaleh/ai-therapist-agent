## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Gmail App Password
- ✅ Already configured: `gtgctqxedceacrsz`
- ⚠️ Keep this secret and secure
- ⚠️ Don't commit to Git (.env is gitignored)
- ⚠️ If compromised, revoke and generate new one

### Email Sending Limits
- Gmail allows: ~500 emails/day
- For higher volume: Use SendGrid, AWS SES, or Mailgun
- Current setup: Perfect for development and small production

### Troubleshooting
If emails don't arrive:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in `.env`
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail
5. Generate new App Password if needed
