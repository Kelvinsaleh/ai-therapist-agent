## üöÄ What YOU Need to Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Email to Render (2 min) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

Your logs show:
```
‚ùå EMAIL_USER is not set
‚ùå EMAIL_PASSWORD is not set
```

**Fix:**

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Find your backend service** (hope-backend-2)

3. **Click "Environment"** tab

4. **Add these 4 variables:**

```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=gtgctqxedceacrsz
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail!

5. **Click "Save Changes"**

6. **Service will auto-redeploy** (wait 2-3 minutes)

---

### Step 2: Deploy Code Fix (3 min)

The login duplicate error is fixed. Deploy it:

**Option A: Push to GitHub (if connected)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Login duplicate token error"
git push origin main
```

Render will auto-deploy.

**Option B: Manual Deploy in Render**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

---

### Step 3: Verify (1 min)

After deployment completes:

1. **Check health:**
   ```
   https://hope-backend-2.onrender.com/health
   ```
   Should return `{"status":"ok"}`

2. **Check logs:**
   - Should show: `‚úÖ Email service initialized successfully`
   - Should NOT show: `‚ùå EMAIL SERVICE NOT CONFIGURED`

3. **Test login:**
   - Try logging in from your frontend
   - Should work without 500 error

---

## üêõ Additional Issues in Logs (Optional)

### Warning: Duplicate Schema Indexes

Your logs show:
```
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"userId":1}
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"email":1}
```

**What this means:** Some mongoose schemas have duplicate index definitions.

**Fix (Optional):** Find schemas with both `index: true` in field definition AND `schema.index()`. Remove one.

**Impact:** Just warnings, doesn't break anything.

## ‚úÖ Expected Result After Fixes

### Logs Should Show:
```
‚úÖ Email service initialized successfully
üìß Using: your-email@gmail.com via smtp.gmail.com:587
üöÄ Server is running on port 3001
Connected to MongoDB Atlas
```

### Login Should Work:
- No more 500 errors
- No duplicate key errors
- Users can login successfully

### Email Should Work:
- Registration sends OTP
- Welcome emails send
- No "EMAIL SERVICE NOT CONFIGURED" errors

---

## üö® If Still Having Issues

### Email Still Not Working:
1. Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in Render exactly match your Gmail
2. Check Gmail App Password is correct (no spaces)
3. Check backend logs for SMTP errors
4. Restart the service in Render

### Login Still Failing:
1. Check logs for new error messages
2. Verify JWT_SECRET is set in Render
3. Try clearing all sessions in MongoDB:
   ```javascript
   // In MongoDB Atlas
   db.sessions.deleteMany({})
   ```

### Need to Clean Database (Nuclear Option):
If you want to start fresh with sessions:
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas
2. Connect to your database
3. Run: `db.sessions.deleteMany({})`
4. Restart backend
