# Email Verification & Production-Ready Profile Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Profile Page - Production Ready** ✨

#### Offline Support
- **localStorage Backup**: All profile changes (goals, preferences, user info) are backed up locally
- **Network Error Detection**: Properly detects and handles connection failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works offline with toast notifications
- **Auto-Sync**: Syncs data when connection is restored

#### Improvements
- ✅ Goals now persist correctly to backend
- ✅ Subscription cancellation fully functional
- ✅ Better error messages with `isNetworkError` flag
- ✅ Array initialization for goals, challenges, interests
- ✅ Proper state updates after save

---

### 2. **Email Verification System** 📧

#### Backend Implementation

**User Model Updates** (`Hope-backend/src/models/User.ts`)
```typescript
- isEmailVerified: boolean (default: false)
- verificationCode: string (6-digit OTP)
- verificationCodeExpiry: Date (10 minutes validity)
```

**Email Service** (`Hope-backend/src/services/email.service.ts`)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML email templates
- ✅ `sendVerificationCode(email, code, name)` - Sends 6-digit OTP
- ✅ `sendWelcomeEmail(email, name)` - Welcome email after verification
- ✅ Development mode: Logs emails to console if not configured
- ✅ Production mode: Uses nodemailer with SMTP

**New API Endpoints**
- `POST /auth/verify-email` - Verify OTP and activate account
- `POST /auth/resend-code` - Resend verification code
- Updated `POST /auth/register` - Creates user, sends OTP, requires verification
- Updated `POST /auth/login` - Checks email verification status

**Dependencies Added**
```json
{
  "nodemailer": "^6.9.7",
  "@types/nodemailer": "^6.4.14"
}
```

#### Frontend Implementation

**New Verification Page** (`app/verify-email/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Beautiful 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
- ✅ Auto-submit when all digits filled
- ✅ Paste support for OTPs
- ✅ Resend code with 60-second cooldown
- ✅ Expiry handling (10-minute timeout)
- ✅ Redirects to dashboard after verification
- ✅ Security warnings and user guidance

**Updated Signup Flow** (`app/signup/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Redirects to `/verify-email` after registration
- ✅ Passes `userId` and `email` as query params
- ✅ Backwards compatible (works with old flow if verification not required)

**Updated Login Flow** (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Detects unverified accounts
- ✅ Redirects to verification page if needed
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

## 🔧 Configuration for Production

### Email Service Setup (REQUIRED)

To enable email sending in production, add these environment variables to your **Hope-backend**:

#### Option 1: Gmail (Recommended for Testing)
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

**Gmail Setup Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable "2-Step Verification"
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Create a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

#### Option 2: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

#### Option 3: AWS SES (Enterprise)
```env
EMAIL_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-aws-smtp-username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-aws-smtp-password
```

### Render Deployment

1. **Go to Render Dashboard** → Hope-backend service
2. **Environment** tab → Add environment variables:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```
3. **Save** → Service will auto-redeploy

## 📝 Testing the Email Verification Flow

### Development (Without Email Configuration)
If email is not configured, the verification code will be **logged to the backend console**:
```
Development mode - Email would have been sent:
To: user@example.com
Subject: Verify Your Hope Therapy Account
Content: ... Your code is: 123456
```

### Production Testing
1. **Sign up** with a real email
2. **Check your inbox** (and spam folder) for verification code
3. **Enter the 6-digit code** on the verification page
4. **Success!** → Redirected to dashboard with session created

### Manual Verification (Development)
If needed, you can manually verify a user in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "user@example.com" },
  { $set: { isEmailVerified: true } }
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Backend wake-up timed out"
- ✅ **Fixed**: Increased timeout to 45 seconds
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added retry logic
- ✅ **Fixed**: Profile changes saved locally if backend unavailable

### "Goals not saving"
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper backend API calls
- ✅ **Fixed**: State synchronization
- ✅ **Fixed**: Array initialization

### "Email not received"
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify email env vars in Render
3. Check backend logs for email sending errors
4. Use resend code button

### "Code expired"
- Codes expire after 10 minutes
- Click "Resend Code" to get a new one

## 📊 Database Migration

**Existing Users**: Old users without `isEmailVerified` field will have it default to `false`. You may want to manually verify existing users:

```javascript
// MongoDB shell or Compass
db.users.updateMany(
  { isEmailVerified: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { isEmailVerified: true } }
)
```

Or, to be safe, only verify users created before the update:

```javascript
db.users.updateMany(
  { 
    isEmailVerified: { $exists: false },
    createdAt: { $lt: new Date('2025-10-22') }
  },
  { $set: { isEmailVerified: true } }
)
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Configure Email Service** (see Configuration section above)
2. **Test Signup Flow**:
   - Create a new account
   - Receive OTP via email
   - Verify account
   - Login successfully
3. **Monitor Backend Logs** on Render for any email errors
4. **Test Profile Features**:
   - Add/remove goals
   - Update profile
   - Test subscription cancellation
5. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure OTP input works smoothly on mobile devices

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better Email Deliverability:
1. Use a professional email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
2. Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
3. Use a verified sending domain
4. Monitor bounce rates

### For Users:
- Code expires in 10 minutes (shown in UI)
- Resend button has 60-second cooldown
- Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive
- Contact support if issues persist

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring Email Service
Check backend logs on Render:
```
[INFO] Verification email sent successfully for user: user@example.com
[WARN] Email service not configured. Skipping email send.
[ERROR] Failed to send email: <error details>
```

### Common Email Errors
- "Authentication failed" → Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD
